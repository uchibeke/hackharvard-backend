        "description": "Home at Last!  After almost FIVE MONTHS and travel across THREE STATES, Cody, the German Shepherd from #Phoenix #MaricopaCo, is back home!  His family has been constantly and diligently search for their dog.  They never gave up!  They made sure his chip information was up to date.  They posted everywhere.  They checked the shelters.  They even used a drone to canvas the neighborhood.  Five months later, they got a call from someone near San Antonio, Texas, almost 1000 miles away!  The couple who found him runs an animal rescue on their property (including Zebras, Camels, etc.) so they obviously have a soft spot for animals in need.  They saw Cody dodging traffic on an interstate, stopped and called him.  He came right to them.  They got him all cleaned up, contacted their vet, took him in and found a microchip!  He is now back in Arizona and home!  We understand he immediately went to his toy when he got home.  From Cody's owner, \" It's a great ending to a very sad and trying few months.  I'm just so happy and pleased that there are wonderful people who found a beautiful dog and did the right thing. Thank you for your care and concern for the lost and the families in need.\"  Missing 5-17-2017.  Back home 10-4-2017.  Welcome home Cody!",
