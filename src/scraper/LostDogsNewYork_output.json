In a statement last month\u201a the bureau description of the scam mirrored Sharp's experience.\n\"Although you may be tempted to do anything to see your dog or cat returned safely\u201a don't pay up! The scammer doesn't have your pet. They will just take the money and disappear.\"\"\nhttps://www.timeslive.co.za/news/south-africa/2017-10-16-beware-social-media-scammers-when-posting-a-reward-for-lost-pets/",
