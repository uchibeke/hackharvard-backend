In addition, we want to remind you that you do not need to pay any website or service to list your missing pet.  There are many, many FREE services like HelpingLostPets.com that will list your pet for FREE. And we are also partnered with many amazing volunteer groups across the country.\n\nhttps://www.timeslive.co.za/news/south-africa/2017-10-16-beware-social-media-scammers-when-posting-a-reward-for-lost-pets/",

What better place to reach a large number of the members of your community and get the word out about your missing pet. When distributing flyers, use the FREE flyer templates from our site to increase awareness about your missing pet and about HelpingLostPets.com and Lost Dogs Georgia. This helps other pets in your community get back home.\n\nWe offer several different templates to choose from. \n\nTemplate #1 - With TearOffs\nTemplate #2 - Photo with detailed information\nTemplate #3 - With large photo\nTemplate #4 - Large photo\n\nAll templates allow you to select the 4-on-a-sheet printing option to cut and hand out. This is a great way to cut down on printing cost and get your flyer out to the public.\n\nTo list a lost or found pet and get a post on our page or the Lost Cats Georgia page and to get your FREE flyer, go to:\n\nwww.HelpingLostPets.com/PET\n\nTo see all our templates, go to: http://www.lostdogsgeorgia.org/tips-for-listing.html\n\nThe dog in this photo is Buster Sey Moore. He's missing from Covington, Georgia and is just one of the many lost dogs listed with us. We would love to help him and all the pets listed with us get back home.",

What better place to reach a large number of the members of your community and get the word out about your missing pet. When distributing flyers, use the FREE flyer templates from our site to increase awareness about your missing pet and about HelpingLostPets.com and Lost Dogs Georgia. This helps other pets in your community get back home.\n\nWe offer several different templates to choose from. \n\nTemplate #1 - With TearOffs\nTemplate #2 - Photo with detailed information\nTemplate #3 - With large photo\nTemplate #4 - Large photo\n\nAll templates allow you to select the 4-on-a-sheet printing option to cut and hand out. This is a great way to cut down on printing cost and get your flyer out to the public.\n\nTo list a lost or found pet and get a post on our page or the Lost Cats Georgia page and to get your FREE flyer, go to:\n\nwww.HelpingLostPets.com/PET\n\nTo see all our templates, go to: http://www.lostdogsgeorgia.org/tips-for-listing.html\n\nThe dog in this photo is Buster Sey Moore. He's missing from Covington, Georgia and is just one of the many lost dogs listed with us. We would love to help him and all the pets listed with us get back home.",

What better place to reach a large number of the members of your community and get the word out about your missing pet. When distributing flyers, use the FREE flyer templates from our site to increase awareness about your missing pet and about HelpingLostPets.com and Lost Dogs Georgia. This helps other pets in your community get back home.\n\nWe offer several different templates to choose from. \n\nTemplate #1 - With TearOffs\nTemplate #2 - Photo with detailed information\nTemplate #3 - With large photo\nTemplate #4 - Large photo\n\nAll templates allow you to select the 4-on-a-sheet printing option to cut and hand out. This is a great way to cut down on printing cost and get your flyer out to the public.\n\nTo list a lost or found pet and get a post on our page or the Lost Cats Georgia page and to get your FREE flyer, go to:\n\nwww.HelpingLostPets.com/PET\n\nTo see all our templates, go to: http://www.lostdogsgeorgia.org/tips-for-listing.html\n\nThe dog in this photo is Buster Sey Moore. He's missing from Covington, Georgia and is just one of the many lost dogs listed with us. We would love to help him and all the pets listed with us get back home.",

What better place to reach a large number of the members of your community and get the word out about your missing pet. When distributing flyers, use the FREE flyer templates from our site to increase awareness about your missing pet and about HelpingLostPets.com and Lost Dogs Georgia. This helps other pets in your community get back home.\n\nWe offer several different templates to choose from. \n\nTemplate #1 - With TearOffs\nTemplate #2 - Photo with detailed information\nTemplate #3 - With large photo\nTemplate #4 - Large photo\n\nAll templates allow you to select the 4-on-a-sheet printing option to cut and hand out. This is a great way to cut down on printing cost and get your flyer out to the public.\n\nTo list a lost or found pet and get a post on our page or the Lost Cats Georgia page and to get your FREE flyer, go to:\n\nwww.HelpingLostPets.com/PET\n\nTo see all our templates, go to: http://www.lostdogsgeorgia.org/tips-for-listing.html\n\nThe dog in this photo is Buster Sey Moore. He's missing from Covington, Georgia and is just one of the many lost dogs listed with us. We would love to help him and all the pets listed with us get back home.",

His family has been constantly and diligently search for their dog.  They never gave up!  They made sure his chip information was up to date.  They posted everywhere.  They checked the shelters.  They even used a drone to canvas the neighborhood.  Five months later, they got a call from someone near San Antonio, Texas, almost 1000 miles away!  The couple who found him runs an animal rescue on their property (including Zebras, Camels, etc.) so they obviously have a soft spot for animals in need.  They saw Cody dodging traffic on an interstate, stopped and called him.  He came right to them.  They got him all cleaned up, contacted their vet, took him in and found a microchip!  He is now back in Arizona and home!  We understand he immediately went to his toy when he got home.  From Cody's owner, \" It's a great ending to a very sad and trying few months.  I'm just so happy and pleased that there are wonderful people who found a beautiful dog and did the right thing. Thank you for your care and concern for the lost and the families in need.\"  Missing 5-17-2017.  Back home 10-4-2017.  Welcome home Cody!",
