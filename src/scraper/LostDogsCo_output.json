        "description": "Coming Home - Using Helping Lost Pets (HeLP)\n\nI first learned about Helping Lost Pets late last year. It is a free, map-based website used to help pets get back home after they have gone missing or are stolen. I promote this website because it interacts with other sites, offers free posters for individual people to use and is easy for animal control agencies to use. Within a few days of beginning to use HeLP for my animal control officer, we were able to get a dog back home who had been missing for more than 3 months. She was found hundreds of miles from her home after having been stolen by some contractors.\n\nI have blogged about HeLP a couple of times.\n\nhttp://www.paws4change.com/blog/a-little-help-from-your-friends-getting-lost-pets-home\n\nhttp://www.paws4change.com/blog/your-pet-is-lost-or-has-been-stolen-now-what\n\nPlease take a little time to learn about this wonderful resource. We have a lot of lost and found pages on social media all operating independently of each other. While the work of these pages is great, some are closed groups and in the end, animals don't know geographic boundaries and can end up many miles from the location we expect them to be. By using HeLP as the primary platform, we really can harness the power of the Internet to get lost pets back home.",

        "description": "Pet Looting\n\nHere's the scenario. You're at your house near Houston. It is not yet flooded.  You think you're going to be safe.  The Army Corps of Engineers opens a dam and with very little warning your house begins filling up with water. You frantically start grabbing things to load up in a vehicle in hopes that you can get out in time. In the process of loading things into a vehicle your dog gets out. You had him leashed and with you all the time, but he's  scared and feeding off of your fear so he pulls away from you. You call for him. You search high and low, but you have to go. Authorities come along, telling you to get in a rescue vehicle right now. You say, \"but I don't know where my dog is,\" and they say, \"don't worry. Someone will find your dog and take care of him.\" You panic and you leave as you call out for your dog.\n\nI think it is easy for people to find fault with those who did not leave the Houston area with their pets. I get that. But it's not always the result of irresponsibility.\n\nI fully support rescue groups that have gone into the affected areas of Texas and who have pulled animals from shelters in order to free up space for local pets to be housed temporarily. I do not support rescue groups who have gone into an affected areas and picked up pets to take them away to points unknown. How in the world are people supposed to find their pets if they've been taken away to another state? For me this is nothing short of pet looting. I know that most people mean well, but they should be pulling unowned animals and leaving the potentially owned animals in the immediate area.\n\nIf you have never lived through a natural disaster you have no idea how you will behave during times of extreme stress. Let's give everyone the benefit of the doubt before we judge them for the animals who are now displaced from home.",
