What better place to reach a large number of the members of your community and get the word out about your missing pet. When distributing flyers, use the FREE flyer templates from our site to increase awareness about your missing pet and about HelpingLostPets.com and Lost Dogs Georgia. This helps other pets in your community get back home.\n\nWe offer several different templates to choose from. \n\nTemplate #1 - With TearOffs\nTemplate #2 - Photo with detailed information\nTemplate #3 - With large photo\nTemplate #4 - Large photo\n\nAll templates allow you to select the 4-on-a-sheet printing option to cut and hand out. This is a great way to cut down on printing cost and get your flyer out to the public.\n\nTo list a lost or found pet and get a post on our page or the Lost Cats Georgia page and to get your FREE flyer, go to:\n\nwww.HelpingLostPets.com/PET\n\nTo see all our templates, go to: http://www.lostdogsgeorgia.org/tips-for-listing.html\n\nThe dog in this photo is Buster Sey Moore. He's missing from Covington, Georgia and is just one of the many lost dogs listed with us. We would love to help him and all the pets listed with us get back home.",

        "description": "Coming Home - Using Helping Lost Pets (HeLP)\n\nI first learned about Helping Lost Pets late last year. It is a free, map-based website used to help pets get back home after they have gone missing or are stolen. I promote this website because it interacts with other sites, offers free posters for individual people to use and is easy for animal control agencies to use. Within a few days of beginning to use HeLP for my animal control officer, we were able to get a dog back home who had been missing for more than 3 months. She was found hundreds of miles from her home after having been stolen by some contractors.\n\nI have blogged about HeLP a couple of times.\n\nhttp://www.paws4change.com/blog/a-little-help-from-your-friends-getting-lost-pets-home\n\nhttp://www.paws4change.com/blog/your-pet-is-lost-or-has-been-stolen-now-what\n\nPlease take a little time to learn about this wonderful resource. We have a lot of lost and found pages on social media all operating independently of each other. While the work of these pages is great, some are closed groups and in the end, animals don't know geographic boundaries and can end up many miles from the location we expect them to be. By using HeLP as the primary platform, we really can harness the power of the Internet to get lost pets back home.",
