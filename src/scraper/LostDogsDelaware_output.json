In addition, we want to remind you that you do not need to pay any website or service to list your missing pet.  There are many, many FREE services like HelpingLostPets.com that will list your pet for FREE. And we are also partnered with many amazing volunteer groups across the country.\n\nhttps://www.timeslive.co.za/news/south-africa/2017-10-16-beware-social-media-scammers-when-posting-a-reward-for-lost-pets/",

        "description": "TIP: DISTRIBUTING FLYERS AT COMMUNITY EVENTS\n\nFall is a great time for community events such as fall festivals. What better place to reach a large number of the members of your community and get the word out about your missing pet. When distributing flyers, use the FREE flyer templates from our site to increase awareness about your missing pet and about HelpingLostPets.com and Lost Dogs Georgia. This helps other pets in your community get back home.\n\nWe offer several different templates to choose from. \n\nTemplate #1 - With TearOffs\nTemplate #2 - Photo with detailed information\nTemplate #3 - With large photo\nTemplate #4 - Large photo\n\nAll templates allow you to select the 4-on-a-sheet printing option to cut and hand out. This is a great way to cut down on printing cost and get your flyer out to the public.\n\nTo list a lost or found pet and get a post on our page or the Lost Cats Georgia page and to get your FREE flyer, go to:\n\nwww.HelpingLostPets.com/PET\n\nTo see all our templates, go to: http://www.lostdogsgeorgia.org/tips-for-listing.html\n\nThe dog in this photo is Buster Sey Moore. He's missing from Covington, Georgia and is just one of the many lost dogs listed with us. We would love to help him and all the pets listed with us get back home.",
